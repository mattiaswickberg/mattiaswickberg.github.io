## Who am I?
My name is Mattias Wickberg, and I am an opera singing teacher of language and communication. 

I am currently working as Lead Teacher at at school called Stockholm Science & Innovation School, situated is Kista north of Stockholm,
which I helped start in 2013. Here I teach Swedish, English, Communication, Interface Design, and when I'm not teaching I'm partly responsible 
for the school's development, particularly when it comes to the pedagogical perspective and use of IT in education. 

Other than that I study Web programming at Linnaeus university, mainly to deepen my knowledge on these matters, but also with the long-term goal of 
teaching these subjects as well as building my own web applications for work. 

In my spare time, what spare time I have after working full-time and studying full-time, I do amateur opera & theatre. The photo you see here 
is from the production I did in spring 2016, where I took the stage as count Fanfaluchi.
