### Client based web programming, examination 1

The first assignment in this course is this web page, as well as some reflections on the technologies involved. I will address these under separate headlines below.

# Pre-compiling CSS
My first thoughts of pre-compiling CSS was a bit sceptical. While I got the idea behind it,
I never really thought of writing the CSS for a site as a very cumbersome task. For sure it can get a bit repetitious,
 but I wasn't really sure the hassle of CSS was enough to warrant a change into scss. Eternally curious as I am, and considering
 the busy schedule of my work life and studies, I'm always interested in trying out methods that may eventually be beneficial and time-saving.

 My impressions so far are after all mostly positive. I think the main advantage that I see myself in this is
 the ability to use variables, which really helps structuring for instance the colour scheme for a site.

I used variables to start figuring out a colour scheme for my site, and tried out the inheritance functionality,
at the moment for my one and only picture, but the idea is that more will come.

Pros of scss are definitely the added functionality of variables, nested rules, inheritance and others.
It does have the potential of making work easier when building at least somewhat more complex sites.

Disadvantages of pre-compiling css? For starters it's another layer to learn and keep track of. For a simple site it may simply not be worth bothering.
In a way scss adds complexity to your css, which of course can be a huge advantage, and in some ways simplify matter - but it can also result in a code that is
more difficult to maintain and overlook.
